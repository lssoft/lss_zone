	It is possible to edit elements inside zone group manually using native SketchUp tools.
	The point is that quantitative information about modified elements which is stored in zone's attributes becomes irrelevant after
	such modification of an element. For example, you may edit ceiling element of a zone manually, but 'ceiling_area' attribute of a zone still
	stores an initial value, because modification of an element simply does not affect zone's attributes.<br>
	Note that tools like 'Attach Labels', 'List Zones' or 'View/Edit Properties' display only attribute's value (not an element's actual geometry)
	so it is important to set actual values for quantitative attributes.<br>
	Use 'Recalculate' command to update all quantitative attributes of selected zone(s).

	<div class="note">
		It is also possible to refresh zone(s) using 'Rebuild' command, but 'Rebuild' command refreshes zone object in a more agressive way.
		It just re-creates it again 'from scratch'. It also ensures
		that all quantitative attributes store relevant information, but it causes changes lost of such elements as walls, floor, ceiling if any,
		because 'Rebuild' command re-creates all those mentioned elements again in contrast with 'Recalculate' command.
		If there were no changes of mentioned above elements, then 'Rebuild' command is actually more preferable.
