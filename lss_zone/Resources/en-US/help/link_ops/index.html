	When links graph is finished it is possible
	<ul>
		<li>to move its nodes</li>
		<li>to build links graph in an active model</li>

	<p><span class="blacksubheader">Post Processing</span></p>
	It is possible to move spheres, which represent graph nodes, inside graph group in a model after its creation,
	then it is possible to refresh links.<br>
	To refresh links after moving spheres inside a group:
	<ul>
		<li>select graph group in a model</li>
		<li>right-click on it and choose "Refresh Links Graph" from pop-up menu or select "Plugins&gt;LSS Zone&gt;Link Openings&gt;Refresh Links Graph" from main menu</li>
	</ul>

	<p><span class="blacksubheader">Note</span> </p> 
	<div class="note">
		The additional result of linking openings is that each adjacent opening becomes marked as internal.
		Each zone stores internal and external openings area separately so linking process affects internal and external openings area obviously.
		It is also possible to launch 'Recalculate' or 'Rebuild' commands to ensure, that internal openings area and external
		openings area of selected zones are actual.
