    It is a procedure of automatic zone's contour generation by picking a point inside a closed space
	bounded by some geometric elements (faces, groups or components, which containing faces) in an active model.<br><br>
	The idea of automatic tracing is based on the assumption, that an average room (or any other closed space)
	has completely closed contour regardless of openings at a certain level above room's floor level.
	This 'check' level has to be located above the highest opening and below room's ceiling.<br>
	So the first step, which is performed before tracing, is computing of coordinates of check point, by adding
	<b>'check height'</b> value to z-coordinate of picked internal point. <b>'Check Height'</b> is an adjustable value: it can be adjusted
	through 'Settings' dialog or right while 'LSS Zone' tool dialog is active just by typing new value using value control
	box, when <b>'pick internal point'</b> mode of a tool is active.<br>
	When <b>'check point'</b> is calculated, tracer makes 'the first shot': it checks if a ray started from <b>'check point'</b> and directed
	the same way as model's	x-axis intersects something in an active model. Tracer is considered to be ready for tracing
	if intersection is detected.<br>
	The point, where intersection took place is very important: it is an <b>'initial point'</b> of a contour being traced. Tracing
	procedure stops after reaching the <b>'initial point'</b>.<br>
	Tracer also reads a material of a face intersected during first step, so it can be used as <b>'walls material'</b> of a zone.

	Zone's contour tracing procedure performs the following steps:
	<ol>
		<li>
			make first tracing step: move tracing <b>aperture</b> one step forward along tracing direction
		</li>
		<li>
			run tracing loop:
			<ul>
				<li>move <b>aperture</b> one step forward along tracing direction</li>
				<li>check if <b>aperture</b> reached the <b>initial point</b></li>
				<li>check if aperture intersected a new bounding face or not</li>
				<li>in case if previous face is detected again: move <b>aperture</b> yet another one step forward along tracing direction</li>
				<li>in case if new bounding face is detected: add new nodal point and set tracing direction parallel to a newly detected bounding face</li>
				<li>check for openings under <b>aperture</b> position if openings checking is enabled</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			exit tracing loop if an <b>aperture</b> reached the <b>initial point</b>

	The main logic is bacically the same as zone's contour tracing. The main difference is that tracing goes on
	in a vertical plane, which is parallel to a plane of a face currently detected by zone's contour tracing aperture.<br>
	So opening tracing performs the following steps:
	<ol>
		<li>
			compute a <b>'check ray'</b>, which will search for openings:
			<ul>
				<li>
					start point of the ray is located a bit lower than room's ceiling level and it shifted from
					wall's surface into wall's body interior at a distance equal to <b>'opening tracing offset'</b>
				</li>
				<li>ray directed downwards parallel to z-axis</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			make first 'check shot' looking for intersection of computed <b>'check ray'</b> with geometry
		</li>
		<li>
			if an intersection was detected and it took place somewhere at level above room's floor level, then
			opening tracer checks if the face being intersected is actually a boundary of an opening:
			<ul>
				<li>
					make the second 'control shot' from the first intersection point
				</li>
				<li>
					the second intersection point has to be also above room's floor level (or directly at a floor level)
				</li>
				<li>
					check if the first intersected face is really a boundary of an opening by 'looking' from
					a point, which is slightly below this face towards wall's interior surface
				</li>
				<li>
					in case if there was no intersections detected at a distance equal to <b>'minimal wall offset'</b>,
					intersected face is considered to be a boundary of an opening
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			if all tests were completed successfully, opening tracer begins tracing from the point of a first intersection
			of opening 'check ray' with the first opening's boundary face
		</li>
		<li>
			opening tracer makes the first tracing step: move tracing <b>aperture</b> one step forward along opening tracing direction<br>
			(opening tracing direction lies in a vertical plane, which is parallel to a wall's interior surface)
		</li>
		<li>
			run tracing loop (the same logic as zone's contour has):
			<ul>
				<li>move <b>aperture</b> one step forward along tracing direction</li>
				<li>check if <b>aperture</b> reached the <b>initial point</b></li>
				<li>check if aperture intersected a new bounding face or not</li>
				<li>in case if previous face is detected again: move <b>aperture</b> yet another one step forward along tracing direction</li>
				<li>in case if new bounding face is detected: add new nodal point to an opening contour and set tracing direction parallel to a newly detected bounding face</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			exit tracing loop if if <b>aperture</b> reached the <b>initial point</b><br>
			(the <b>initial point</b> of opening tracing is a point where vertical <b>'check ray'</b> intersected first opening's bounding face)
		</li>
